chrome-dogkeeper
================

A chrome plugin which is intended to reload datadog dashboards.

We have a couple of machines running google chrome instances with dashboards
from datadoghq.com at the office, and sometimes due to network issues, or
rarely because of outages at datadog, the dashboards stop working and someone
had to manually refresh them using either a remote desktop connection or a
mouse...

Until now!
